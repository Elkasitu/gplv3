# gplv3
gplv3 is a simple bash script used to download the latest revision of the GPLv3
license to the current working directory and save it as a LICENSE file

## why?
Because I always use the GPLv3 license for most of my projects and adding it
is annoying because I have to go find the URL, remember the proper curl cmd,
etc.

## wow you'r so lazy
Aren't we all?

## how to
`sudo chmod +x gplv3`
`sudo cp gplv3 /usr/local/bin/`
